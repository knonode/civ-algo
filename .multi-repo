Multi-Repository Approach for Web Apps
Common Multi-Repo Structure

Frontend repository: Contains your React + TypeScript + Vite code
Backend/API repository: Contains your server code, API endpoints
Database repository: Might contain database migration scripts, schemas, etc.
Shared libraries repository: Optional repo for code shared between frontend and backend

How This Works in Practice
For your stack example:

Your React frontend would be in one repository, deployed to Vercel
Your backend API would be in another repository, possibly deployed to Vercel Serverless Functions or another service
Database migrations and schema definitions might be in a third repository
Each repository would have its own package.json, build process, and deployment pipeline

Development Workflow
When working across multiple repositories:

You'd need to clone each repository separately
You might use local npm packages with npm link or package versioning to connect them
You'd make changes, commit, and push to each repository independently
CI/CD would be configured separately for each repository

Common Connection Methods

Package publishing: Shared code is published to npm or a private registry
API contracts: Frontend and backend communicate through defined API contracts
Environment variables: Used to connect services together in different environments


VSCode/Cursor Multi-Repo Support
Workspace Features

Multi-root Workspaces: Both VSCode and Cursor support multi-root workspaces, which allow you to open multiple repositories as a single workspace.

Create a workspace file (.code-workspace) that includes paths to different repositories
Switch between different workspaces easily
Share workspace configurations with teammates


Split Editors and Windows: Easily view code from different repositories side by side

Split view horizontally or vertically
Drag and drop editors to arrange your layout



Extensions

Project Manager: Save and quickly switch between different projects or repository combinations

Easily organize and group related repositories
Quickly switch contexts between different project configurations


GitLens: Enhanced git capabilities that work well across repositories

View git history, blame information, and compare across branches
Works across multiple repositories in your workspace


Remote Repositories: Browse and edit code directly from GitHub without cloning
GitHub Pull Requests: Review PRs from different repositories in the same interface
REST Client: Test APIs across your different services

Terminal Management

Integrated Terminal: Run commands in different repositories simultaneously

Split terminals to monitor different repositories
Configure terminal profiles for different project contexts


Tasks: Configure workspace-level tasks that can run across repositories

Set up start/build tasks for different services
Create compound tasks that operate across repositories



External Tools

Docker & Docker Compose: Run multiple services locally without complex setup

Define dependencies between services from different repositories
Simplify environment setup across repositories


Postman/Insomnia: Test and document APIs across your separated services
GitHub/GitLab Integrations: Both editors integrate well with remote repository services

Workflow Tips

Use consistent naming conventions across repositories
Set up standardized environment variable handling
Create scripts to clone/pull all related repositories at once
Consider using git submodules or git subtree for some cases

For your specific Vite + React + TypeScript setup with Vercel and Neon, you could create a workspace that includes your frontend, backend, and any shared libraries, allowing you to work across them simultaneously while maintaining the separation of repositories.
